### üõ°Ô∏è Predictive Health Insurance Model for Shield Insurance
This project is a partnership between Shield Insurance and AtliQ AI to develop a predictive model for estimating health insurance premiums.
The model will predict premium costs based on key factors like 
age, smoking habits, BMI, and medical history. The project's ultimate goal is to create infrastructure for straight-through processing (STP) of insurance quotes.

### ‚ú® Key Features & Deliverables
This project is divided into two phases, with the current focus on Phase 1 (MVP).


* High-Accuracy Model: A predictive model with over 97% accuracy. The model's predictions must be highly precise, with the percentage difference between predicted and actual values being less than 10% for at least 95% of the errors.


* Cloud Deployment: The final model will be deployed on a cloud platform to ensure it is secure, scalable, and accessible from anywhere.



* Interactive UI: A Streamlit application that allows insurance underwriters to input factors and receive real-time premium predictions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Project Plan (Phase 1)
Phase 1 focuses on building and deploying a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).


* Data Collection & Preprocessing (2 weeks): This stage involves collecting and cleaning labeled datasets and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).



* Model Development (4 weeks): Multiple models will be trained and evaluated to find the best-performing one, which will then be optimized for accuracy.



* Deployment & App Development (3 weeks): This involves deploying the model to the cloud and building the interactive Streamlit application.


* Testing & Documentation (2 weeks): The final stage includes rigorous testing with real-world data, providing documentation, and training for the underwriters.
